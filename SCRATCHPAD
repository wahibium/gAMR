Steps of AMR

      Init Mesh with values
	  FOR (Time Integration)
        Execute stencil operation in all blocks
        IF (Time for regridding)
        		Execute error function on all blocks
        		Coarse
        		Refine
        		Balance tree		\COMMENT{more refinement}
        ENDIF
        IF (Time for load balancing)
        		Gather data about loads
        		Identify movement towards over-loaded PEs
        		Migrate blocks to balance loads
        ENDIF
     ENDFOR





refine 
    - Interpolate similar to LBM
    - Use 8 different arrays
coarse
    - For recursive coarse, it's a "reduce operation"
    - For non-recursive coarse, it's a partial reduce operation
operation
error
    - When a cell is above thershold, don't eval. other cells in the block (i.e. abort)
